# Real-Time-Digit-Recognition-System
Real-time Handwritten digit recognition system implemented using Streamlit and OpenCV. 

## Description
This project allows users to draw digits in a designated box, and the integrated machine-learning model predicts the corresponding digit (0-9) in real-time.

## Features
- User interactive
- Real-time Prediction
- Streamlit Integration
- Graphical probabilities for predicted digits

## Requirements
- VsCode/PyCharm
- Python 3.10 or above
- protobuf <=3.20.*
- Tensorflow
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- Jupyter/Collab (any notebook)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```
   git clone https://github.com/meabhi2206/Real-Time-Digit-Recognition-System.git
   ```
2. Run the dicpy.py file
   ```python -m streamlit run dicpy.py```

3. Open in Browser:
   Visit `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser to access the real-time digit recognition application.
